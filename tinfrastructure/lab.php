			Well-equipped computer laboratories are available to the students. All the computers in these laboratories have latest configuration and are connected to a LAN, which provides a networked environment to the students. A wireless access to the network is also available through Wi-Fi. Qualified instructors give the practical training. The laboratory contains all necessary software, and audio-visual tutoring aids to impart the training more effectively. The Internet facility with high bandwidth is also available to the students at no extra cost so that they can have an access to the unlimited wealth of information on the net.<br><br>
			Accepting the pervasiveness of computers in our lives, we concentrate on exploitation and integration of the same into our education system to the full extent. We use continuous evalutaion system for the practical lab session teaching which are graded accurately and fast along with automated submission dues, saving lot of time and energy as compared to the conventional paper based submission systems.<br>
